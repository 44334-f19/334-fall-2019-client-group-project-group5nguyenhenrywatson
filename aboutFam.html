    <p><b>“We are an animal loving family”</b> - John has raised show pigeons since he was just a young boy and continues to raise them today. He actually passed this tradition on to his daughters, who also raise and show pigeons.  Cheryl has always been a dog lover and started her work with them in obedience training at 11 years old.  She continued on with her passion to work as a veterinary assistant for her first job, then became a dog groomer over 30 years ago - she has had had her own grooming shop for last 15 of those 30 years.  For 22 years, she raised and bred golden retrievers.  That was the breed she fell in love with at first, and they were perfect for her family during those years.<br><br>Now, as Cheryl and her husband are getting older, they wanted a family pet that was smaller/more of a lap dog, yet still had a fun personality.  She enjoyed the Yorkie breed as a groomer and decided it was a perfect fit for their lifestyle now - the feisty spirit of the breed did not disappoint, as the family have all come to adore the big-dog personality of their little pups.</p>
